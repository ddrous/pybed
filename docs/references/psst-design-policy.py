#%% 1) Imports, policy configuration, and experiment conventions
"""Sequential Bayesian experimental-design policy on top of a pretrained Bayes Transport model.

This script is intentionally notebook-like (``#%%`` cells) and has no ``main()`` function.  It is
meant to be copied into, and executed FROM, a completed Bayes-Transport run directory.  By default
it loads ``./artefacts/model_best.eqx`` and writes a separate policy run under ``./policy_runs``.

Core loop
---------
1. Draw theta* and a base-prior particle cloud.  One episode has ``experimental_budget``
   sequential policy decisions (30 by default).
2. The policy ALWAYS consumes (a) the current cloud and (b) the ENTIRE design/outcome history and
   proposes K designs jointly. Two regimes are available. The default SEPARATE policy has its own
   cloud/history Transformer. If all four Bayes-component reuse switches are enabled, the code
   automatically enters an ALINE-style JOINT regime with one shared inference/acquisition backbone.
3. Reparameterise the Gaussian observation model to simulate outcomes at those designs.
4. Update the belief with the pretrained Bayes Transport. In SEPARATE mode this is an explicit
   Bayes-map call after the policy action. In JOINT ALINE-style mode, the shared posterior Transformer
   returns both the posterior cloud and the features used to emit the NEXT design set in one call.
   Genuine multi-observation checkpoints consume the K observations jointly with observation_count=K.
5. Reward the policy using the configured posterior loss and time reference.
   ``reward_reference='initial'`` gives dense prefix improvement loss(C_0)-loss(C_t),
   ``reward_reference='previous'`` gives one-step improvement loss(C_{t-1})-loss(C_t), and
   ``reward_reference='terminal'`` gives zero reward before the final step and -loss(C_T) at T.
6. Repeat with the posterior cloud as the next prior.

Gradient estimators
-------------------
``gradient_estimator='pathwise'`` differentiates through the reparameterised policy action,
Gaussian likelihood sample, and frozen Bayes Transport.  This is the pathwise/reparameterisation
estimator of Mohamed et al. (2020), Eq. 29.

``gradient_estimator='reinforce'`` detaches sampled actions/environment transitions and uses the
score-function / REINFORCE estimator.  The default dense reward mirrors ALINE's idea of using
one-step posterior improvement (Huang et al., 2025, Eq. 10) with a policy-gradient objective
(Eq. 11), but substitutes the empirical-cloud concentration/energy-score improvement requested
for this project.  An optional EMA baseline is included as a variance-reduction control variate;
Mohamed et al. (2020), Eq. 14 shows that subtracting a constant baseline preserves unbiasedness.

Evaluation
----------
The script evaluates learned versus uniform-random design policies with common truth/prior/noise
samples.  It reports sequential Prior Contrastive Estimation (sPCE) as an EIG lower bound (the
same BED metric used in ALINE's experiments), energy score, attraction, posterior-mean RMSE,
spread, covariance log-volume, and interval coverage.  It also recreates the Bayes-Transport
``fixed_trajectory_epoch_XXXXXX.png`` style plot, now using strategic designs, and produces a
side-by-side strategic-vs-policy-specific-fixed-random trajectory comparison.

Important compatibility point
-----------------------------
The policy has its OWN configuration below, including min/max source count, min/max source
dimensionality, held-out shapes, and four explicit Bayes-component reuse switches (prior embedder,
likelihood Transformer, observation embedder, posterior Transformer). For a heterogeneous/dimension-agnostic Bayes checkpoint, downstream shapes only need to fit inside
the checkpoint's padded maxima; they may be fixed, narrower, below the original training minima, or
otherwise out-of-distribution. In JOINT mode the pretrained agnostic embedders are retained exactly.
Only a genuinely fixed-shape Bayes checkpoint requires an exact downstream shape match. Remaining legacy Bayes-Transport architecture
values are recovered automatically by safely parsing the archived training script so the Equinox
checkpoint skeleton matches the pretrained model. The old fixed-point/drifting/replay-buffer
training machinery is deliberately absent from this file.
Training is organized into explicit epochs even though every optimizer step uses newly simulated data;
per-step and per-epoch losses are both stored and plotted.

    the vmapped direct posterior transports.  This is causal context construction, not a

    The exact Omin=Omax=1 case is intentionally simpler: there is no observation sequence to

    learns the modulation projection directly from it.

    For genuine multi-observation prefixes, the dimension-aggregation module and the likelihood
    Transformer retain their previous separate responsibilities.  In heterogeneous-shape mode
    the input width is E; in fixed-shape mode it is D+1.  The active Transformer owns a learned
