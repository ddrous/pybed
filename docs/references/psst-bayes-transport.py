"""Single-cloud Bayes transport with energy-score, DEQ, and drifting training modes.

The simulator, posterior Transformer, observation-prefix handling, physical particle
representation, heterogeneous (S,D) support, and evaluation protocol retain the original
structure. Training is selected by ``training_mode``:

* ``"energy_score"``: one prior->posterior transport optimized by the exact empirical
  multivariate energy score.
* ``"deq_fixed_point"``: one theta* supplies a finite sequence of fresh observation blocks.
  The resulting recurrent Bayes trajectory is represented as an augmented triangular equilibrium
  and differentiated with a custom implicit VJP. The memory-safe ``triangular`` solver exploits
  this causal structure directly; Picard and Anderson remain available for forward/backward
  ablations. No forward root-finder iteration is differentiated through.
* ``"drifting"``: one ordinary transport call, followed by frozen-target regression toward
  ``x + eta V(x)``. There is NO inner time/fixed-point rollout in this mode: as in Deng et al.,
  evolution occurs across optimizer steps because the network parameters change. The default
  field combines the paper's anti-symmetric kernel attraction/repulsion field with an optional
  energy-score-gradient contribution.

The ``energy_score`` and ``drifting`` modes can additionally train on the model's own historical
predictions. A bounded host-side replay buffer stores recent final-prefix output clouds together
with the theta* and observation block that produced that output (plus minimal shape metadata needed
for heterogeneous padded batches). With configurable probability a future training row starts from
one of these detached historical clouds instead of a fresh interpolated cloud and reuses the EXACT
same observation block. Thus the model is deliberately challenged with the same evidence but a
changed prior cloud, exposing it to its own
past output distribution without creating a cross-step autodiff graph. Otherwise the original
shared-tau interpolated prior remains the default input.

Evaluation is deliberately independent of ``training_mode``. Non-sequential evaluation always
uses the original direct ``predict_prefixes`` map and exact empirical energy score; sequential
evaluation always repeatedly applies the same learned Bayes map with ``jax.lax.scan``.

Synthetic fresh training priors are intentionally simple. Draw theta* from the configured base
prior (Uniform on the physical design box or isotropic Gaussian). With probability
``synthetic_prior_match_probability`` use theta* as the interpolation anchor, otherwise draw an
independent anchor from the same base prior. Draw one shared tau ~ Uniform[0,1] for the entire
cloud and set C_tau,n=(1-tau)Z_n+tau*anchor. No particle-wise tau laws or alternative truth
sampling modes are retained.

When both source count and source dimensionality are fixed, ``fixed_shape_learned_projection``
controls the input interface. If False, the historical parameter-free normalized physical inputs
are used. If True, each fixed-shape theta particle and each fixed-shape design/outcome token gets
one learnable linear projection into ``embedding_dim``. This gives fixed-shape runs the same
embedding-space interface used by heterogeneous-shape runs without instantiating the full TAMO
aggregation Transformers.

    the vmapped direct posterior transports.  This is causal context construction, not a

    The exact Omin=Omax=1 case is intentionally simpler: there is no observation sequence to

    learns the modulation projection directly from it.

    For genuine multi-observation prefixes, the dimension-aggregation module and the likelihood
    Transformer retain their previous separate responsibilities.  In heterogeneous-shape mode
    the input width is E; in fixed-shape mode it is D+1.  The active Transformer owns a learned
